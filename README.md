# A Bot For Pigs

A Discord bot truly fit for pigs.

---

### Setup

Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as runtime.

1. Clone repo
2. Create a file called `.env` in the project folder. This file should include `BOT_TOKEN=xxx` with your bot account token, and `GEMINI_TOKEN=xxx` for Google Gemini support.
3. `bun install`
4. `bun start` to start running the bot.

If you want it to support the restart command: `./bootstrapper.sh`
